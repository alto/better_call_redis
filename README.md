# BetterCallRedis

Active Record Callback that pushes notification of creation or deletion to a Redis channel.
Redis pushes a message (notification) to a channel with a configurable namespace when an active record entry is created or deleted.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'better_call_redis'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install better_call_redis

## Usage

### Initializer

All those initialize options are optional.
"Redis.new" will be used with default connection options if not specified.
"bettercallredis:notification" is the default namespace.
"deleted_attributes" for logically deleted active record models (ex: table column deleted or cancelled). Default is an empty array.

```ruby
BetterCallRedis::configure do |bcr|
  bcr.redis              = Redis.new
  bcr.namespace          = "bettercallredis:notification"
  bcr.deleted_attributes = %w(deleted cancelled)
end
```

Include the following in your active record model class to enable redis channel notification messages.

```ruby
include BetterCallRedis::ActiveRecord
```
